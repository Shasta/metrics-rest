# Metrics REST API

## Overview

The trusted metrics relay is an API REST, that allows to check if the electric counter metadata is correctly stored in IPFS, and saves a backup to a MongoDB instance, to be able to recreate all the metrics history if IPFS goes down in an hypothecal case.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:Shasta/metrics-rest.git
cd metrics-rest
```

Install dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

Set environment (vars):
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Start server:
```sh
# Start server
npm start

# Selectively set DEBUG env var to get logs
DEBUG=metrics-rest:* npm start
```
Refer [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) to know how to selectively turn on logs.


Tests:
```sh
# Run tests written in ES6 
npm run test

# Run test along with code coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests on file change
npm run test:watch

# Run tests enforcing code coverage (configured via .istanbul.yml)
npm run test:check-coverage
```

Lint:
```sh
# Lint code with ESLint
npm run lint

# Run lint on any file change
npm run lint:watch
```


##### Deployment

```sh
# compile to ES5
1. npm run build

# upload dist/ to your server
2. scp -rp dist/ user@dest:/path

# install production dependencies only
3. NODE_ENV=production npm run start

# Use any process manager to start your services
4. pm2 start dist/index.js
```

## Logging

Universal logging library [winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) is used for logging. It has support for multiple transports.  A transport is essentially a storage device for your logs. Each instance of a winston logger can have multiple transports configured at different levels. For example, one may want error logs to be stored in a persistent remote location (like a database), but all logs output to the console or a local file. We just log to the console for simplicity, you can configure more transports as per your requirement.

#### API logging
Logs detailed info about each api request to console during development.

#### Error logging
Logs stacktrace of error to console along with other details. You should ideally store all error messages persistently.

## Code Coverage
Get code coverage summary on executing `yarn test`

`yarn test` also generates HTML code coverage report in `coverage/` directory. Open `lcov-report/index.html` to view it.

## Docker

#### Using Docker Compose for Development
```sh
# service restarts on file change
bash bin/development.sh
```

#### Building and running without Docker Compose
```bash
# To use this option you need to make sure mongodb is listening on port 27017

# Build docker 
docker build -t express-mongoose-es6-rest-api .

# Run docker
docker run -p 4040:4040 express-mongoose-es6-rest-api
```
